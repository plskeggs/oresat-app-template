# Example manifest file you can include into the main west.yml file.
#
# To make this work, copy this file's contents to a new file,
# 'example.yaml', in the same directory.
#
# Then change the 'name' and 'url' below and run 'west update'.
#
# Your module will be added to the local workspace and kept in sync
# every time you run 'west update'.
#
# If you want to fetch a particular commit rather than the main
# branch, change the 'revision' line accordingly.
